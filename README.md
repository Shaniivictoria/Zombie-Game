# Zombie-Game

This is a zombie shooting game. The game is pertain too shooting 4 zombies before they shoot you down. It has a two player function and a timer. Once the timer is up the second play jumps in and starts shooting the zombies as well. If the Zombies get you, then you are dead. The zombies are also shooting you with waterguns for safety purposes. :) 

My motivation behind building this project was to learn how to use more of the JS and how it interacts in a game form. 

 I built the zombie game because I one, love zombies and believe we are all going to be zombies soon haha, no seriously! But I use to play a game where you 
 use to shoot zombies and i felt like the zombie game could have been better.
 
 I learned so much building this game. I learned that you can use onclick in HTML and in JS. But the JS function works better because it give you more
 to work with and more flexibility with changing your code if you needed too.
 
 To play the game:
 
 You click start button
 Once you click the button A zombie will try to shoot you
 Once you aim and Shoot at the zombie he dies. 
 If the zombie gets you first then you die.
 Once you die it goes to player 2.
 If you shoot the zombie then the next zombie comes up, and will continue 4 times. 
 Then you will and Game over. 
 
 Very easy simple game to create. A beginers game. 
 
 Hope you like. <3
